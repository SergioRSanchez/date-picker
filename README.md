<h1><strong>Date Picker</strong></h1>

<p>Seventeenth Challenge was to create a Date Picker. I made it using Vite + React + Tailwind!</p>
<br>
<p>I used moment, a JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates. React-transition-group, a set of components for managing component states, over time, specifically designed with animation in mind. Vite-plugin-svgr, a plugin to transform SVGs into React components, and styled-components, for some styling solutions.</p>
